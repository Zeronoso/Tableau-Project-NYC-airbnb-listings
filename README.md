# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
This project for Tableau dives into the New York City airbnb listings of its five distinct Boroughs from the time period of 2008 to 2012. My main goal with this dataset was to visual the average rental prices of airbnb listings based primarly on their neighbourhood location, bed amnenity count, and room type. Along with 
signifying the difference between single-listers and multi-listers for potential renters and investors to answer the following questions.

#1.
Visualizing the average rent throughout New York City could help both potential renters decide where to search for when renting; along with potential investors in what Boroughs would have the greatest return for their investments. 
This would require further research in propertery prices to make comparisons that I won't be covering in this presentation.

#2. 
Indicate the difference between airbnb host id's that have a single-listing or multi-listings could potentially indiciate certain trends such as the following.
